<p>
  Karl and I were friends for years and the words I have at hand cannot do justice to my love for him or my sadness at his passing.
  My deepest condolences to Janet, Kurt and Elise and all his friends and family.

<p>
  I'm including a few pictures of Karl I had lying around.  They aren't milestones, mostly just moments.

<h2>OOPSLA 1990</h2>

<p>
  Karl and I worked on DEC Trellis for several years. In 1990 we were getting ready for our first release
  and the whole team went to Ottawa for OOPSLA 1990 to show off what we had. 
  I think this picture was at a conference banquet.

<h2>A Lunchtime Walk 1992</h2>

  This day was nothing special. We were working at the DEC Spit Brook Road facility and went for a walk around the property.

<h2>Portland 1994</h2>

<p>
  We were in Portland for OOPSLA, Karl, Lydia Bennett and myself, taking a break, sitting in the sun.

<h2>Timberline Lodge, Mt Hood</h2>
<p>

<p>
  After the conference Karl and I drove up the Columbia River Gorge, checking out the waterfalls. 
  We stayed at the Timberline Lodge and it snowed overnight.

<p>
  We celebrated my 40th birthday at the Mellow Mushroom in Raleigh. Mind-blowing magic provided by Joel Givens.

<h2>Memories without Pictures</h2>
<p>
  Karl and I took a couple of architecture classes together at the Harvard Extension School; they were just continuing educaton
  classes. We would drive down to Cambridge after work and search for restaurants and beer. Spicy food was often on the menu.
  I remember one time we were served this sausage that was so spicy my tongue swelled up and I could hardly talk for about 15 
  minutes. 
</p>

<p>
  Karl introduced me to this authentic chinese restaurant he found in Hudson NH. The food was out of this world. 
  We discovered one day that they had a secret menu that was only available in Chinese. So after that, we would always 
  order off the Chinese menu. We had no idea what we would get, but we built a tiny map of the menu on a business card 
  I kept in my wallet so we could eventually dicipher what all the good stuff was.
