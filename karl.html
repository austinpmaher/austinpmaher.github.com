<p>
  Karl and I were friends for years and the words I have at hand cannot do justice to my love for him or my sadness at his passing.
  My deepest condolences to Janet, Kurt and Elise and all his friends and family.

<p>
  My friendship with Karl spanned decades. 
  We worked together twice, once at the Digital Equipment Corporation in New Hampshire 
  and then again at Knowledge Systems Corporation in Cary NC.

  Karl and I worked on DEC Trellis for several years. In 1990 we were getting ready for our first release
  and the whole team went to Ottawa for OOPSLA 1990 to show off what we had. 
  I think this picture was at a conference banquet.

  I think we were in Portland, maybe for SIGNMOD 1989? Karl, Lydia Bennett and myself, taking a break, sitting in the sun.

<p>
  After the conference Karl and I drove up the Columbia River Gorge, checking out the waterfalls. 
  We stayed at the Timberline Lodge and it snowed overnight.

  This day was nothing special. We were working at the DEC Spit Brook Road facility and went for a walk around the property.

  We celebrated my 40th birthday at the Mellow Mushroom in Raleigh. Mind-blowing magic provided by Joel Givens.
