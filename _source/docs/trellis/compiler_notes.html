<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Owl Notes
-- 1 Michael Kilian</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is the first in
a series of notes I plan to release on the Owl compiler and the revisions
it is going through. I am writing these notes not just to show how the
Owl compiler works on the inside, but also how you can apply object oriented
programming even without an object oriented language like Owl.</FONT></FONT></I>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Object Oriented Nomenclature</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are a lot of terms
used in Object Oriented Programming. With the advent of Smalltalk (which
seems to rename every conventional notion) there are have been a lot of
terms thrown around. The following is a list of terms, some of general
use, some particular to the implementation of Owl. It is by no means complete.</FONT></FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Object -- This is the center
of attention. An Object is a collection of data surrounded by a set of
routines which manipulate that data. The only way the object is modified
is through the routines associated with it. In Owl, Objects have a specific
type. Type_Modules (another Owl term) contain Operations which work on
objects associated with that type module (having that type). See the definitions
of Type Module, Operation, Component and Fixed Name below for a more complete
description.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hierarchy, Inheritance --
Two more fundamental terms in Object Oriented Programming. Types are often
arranged in hierarchies. This allows inheritance of operations, the process
by which operations belonging to one type are assumed by another object.
In Smalltalk, a type (called ''class'' by Smalltalk people) may only have
one parent class (though the parent may have many children classes). This
is single inheritance and it forms a tree. In Owl, there is multiple inheritance
where a number of types (our term for class) may be the parents of a type
(i.e., a graph instead of a tree). In either case, all of the operations
contained in the parents are inherited by the children. The children may
add further operations to themselves and pass these augmented sets of operations
down to their children.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<DIR>
<DIR><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>This allows easy sharing
of common code. For example, there might be a generic stack type with several
children, for example, stack of integers, stack of operators, stack of
characters, etc. The stack type can provide the basic push and pop operations,
and the specific stacks can inherit these and add other routines for their
particular purposes.</FONT></FONT></DIR>
</DIR>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Type and Subtype -- In Owl,
the basic hierarchy is expressed in terms of types and sub-types. A sub-type
is simply a type which inherits from another type. All types are sub-types
of at least the Object type. The Object type (also present in Smalltalk)
is the root of all types and is the only type without a supertype. In Owl,
type and subtype have the relationship that if an object of one type can
be passed to an operation, an object of the subtype can also be passed
to the operation.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Strong Typing -- Strong typing
is where every argument to an operation and every expression must obey
certain type rules. This includes making sure that every parameter to every
routine is consistent with a specified type. Pascal is a strongly typed
language. C and Smalltalk are not. Owl is a strongly typed language which
makes it unique among object oriented languages which rely somewhat on
the lack of type information for their execution. Languages which are strongly
typed are also called type safe since certain programming errors can be
recognized and avoided by catching all type inconsistencies at compile
time. Because it is strongly typed, Owl can guarantee that there will be
an appropriate operation for every invocation in the language.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Parameterized Type -- To make
types more flexible, it is often desirable to allow them to have a parameter.
For example, a type specifying a list is not terribly useful if it can
only be a list of one type of thing. A list is also not very type-safe
if it can accept any object (i.e., a list of type Object). One solution
is to have a list of type P, where P can be filled in later (denoted by
List(P)). P is said to be a parameter to the type. It is then possible
to have a type List(Integer) where Integer replaces P everywhere in the
type specification (e.g., pop may return a type P which is then replaced
with Integer).</FONT></FONT></LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Workspace -- The workspace
is the entire contents of the Owl environment. It contains the compiler,
the compiler data structures and the compiled Owl type modules. Due to
the large amount of information included in the workspaces, they tend to
be very large (around 10 Megabyte).</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Type Module -- A type module
specifies a type including what fields it contains, the operations on those
fields and the relationship of the type in the hierarchy.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Operation -- An operation
accepts an object which is the same type as the type module the operation
resides in and performs some action on that object. Occasionally, operations
accept not an object of a specific type, but the type itself. An example
of this is the Create operation which creates an object of a specific type.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Fixed Name -- This would be
considered a constant in most other languages. However, a very complicated
expression can be assigned as the value of a fixed name. This expression
would be evaluated once and serve as the constant value for the rest of
the program's execution.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Component -- Often a programmer
simply wants to have a piece of data read or written, perhaps with some
filtering. A specialized notation has been introduced for these types of
operations. Components are really shorthand for two operations, GET and
PUT on that data. The shorthand also allows a record like notation for
accessing components, e.g., ME.foo means to extract the foo component from
the object ME.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Owl Notes -- 2 Michael Kilian</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is the second note
in a set of notes on object oriented programming and the Owl Compiler.
It describes some basic ideas which are being used to implement an incremental
compiler for Owl and shows an example of how to use object oriented programming
with a non-object-oriented language.</FONT></FONT></I>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Owl Compiler Methodology</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>As with most programming
languages, Owl allows programs to be broken down into smaller units of
code. The primary units of a program are:</FONT></FONT>
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Workspace -- The entire body
of code and results from the execution of that code. It also includes the
symbol tables and other information which the compiler collects.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Type Module -- All code is
a member of one type module or another. Notice that the type module does
not contribute any code itself; it provides a context for the operations,
components and fixed names within it.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Operation -- This is really
the major concern of the compiler. Owl matches invocations to operation
definitions through the type information it has. The compiler also propagates
operations down the hierarchy.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</OL>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Owl compiler under development
will treat Workspaces, Type Modules and Operations as types. There are
a (large) set of operations which manipulate objects of these data types.
For example, there is an operation ws_add_type_module(ws,tm) which inserts
the type module (tm) into workspace ws. While this seems natural, it is
not the typical method of compilation (typical compilers are organized
in compilation passes).</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unfortunately, compilation
passes do not often lend themselves to incremental compilation. In incremental
compilation, a small part of the program is compiled and then combined
with other parts of the program that were previously compiled. In a strongly
typed language, this problem is compounded by requiring that separately
compiled modules type-check. This means that a routine which calls another
routine in a previously compiled module must still have all of its arguments
checked for consistency.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the compiler under development,
the emphasis is on incremental compilation. It quickly becomes obvious
that the standard idea of compilation passes doesn't function very well
in an environment where there exist data structures in a variety of states.
For example, you may be adding an operation to a pre-existing type module.
In a language such as BLISS, you might only need to compile the operation
and link it in. In Owl, there are many more issues to face. The added operation
may supercede a previously inherited one in that type module. It may also
conflict in a subtype as it is inherited down the hierarchy. To attack
this problem, we are viewing the workspace as a database with operations
to manipulate definitions in type modules.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Object oriented techniques
do not make the problem any simpler in terms of possible conflicts and
special cases. However, they do make it easier to get to a solution which
is fairly clean and easy to talk about. In the above example, you can devise
several operations on type modules which make the problem more manageable.
The first activity is: Add-Operation-to-Type-Module. This is the top level
operation. It may be made up of Add-Operation-to-Only-This-Type-Module
(i.e., don't worry about inheritance). This operation may notice that an
operation already exists which needs to be removed from the type module
(it was inherited and is now superceded). It may then call Delete-Operation-from-Type-Module
which has a set of operations under it. Another part of addition may be
Inherit-this-operation-into-that-Type-Module. This would take care of making
the operation added in a supertype known to subtypes.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>The solution looks a little
more reasonable now. The idea of operations working on a type module data
type gives us a framework for developing the code needed to make the solution
work. It also makes it easy to pinpoint what operations should be global
and what should remain private to a module (Owl uses the terms Public and
Private). This makes the interface to the data type easily and exactly
defined so that people adding features to the compiler need not learn the
messy details of the compiler.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Another benefit of this
design methodology is that information hiding becomes natural. In the operation
addition example, it may be necessary to check that the specification of
an operation match some other specification. If one specification is ''old''
(i.e., has already been compiled) and the other one is ''new'' (being compiled),
certain calculations may need to be performed on the new one to make it
analyzable. This difference need only be visible to the routines analyzing
the operation object. It can look at the state of the object and, if it
is new, do the calculations necessary to allow the analysis to go on. No
one else need know about the difference so that it is natural to say:</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>IF analyze_specification(.new)
EQL analyze_specification(.old) THEN ...</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>The analyze_specification
routine may even cache its analysis somewhere in the operation object to
make retrieval quicker in the future. Again, this fact is completely hidden
from the rest of the routines, making code easier to understand and less
''special case-y.''</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>You may notice that this
example sounds very much like top-down programming. It is. But the emphasis
is in top-down developing a set of routines which manipulate an object.
Once this is done, principles of inheritance can be used to determine what
code can be shared and what types of modifications are needed for code
that can't be directly shared. The compiler treats components like a subtype
of operation. Components add information to two operations; this is a common
occurrence in a hierarchy of types. Components can therefore use most of
the routines associated with operations with a few additional ones and
a few modifications. Operations, Components and Fixed Names can all be
considered subtypes of another type called definition. They therefore inherit
common routines for inserting a definition into a type module.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>These techniques do not
require an object oriented language to be implemented. The Owl Compiler
is being developed in BLISS, which is about as far from object oriented
as you can get. However, by using the object oriented methodology, the
design of modules becomes simpler and the re-use of code easier to determine.</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Owl Notes -- 3 Michael Kilian</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is the third note
in a set of notes on object oriented programming and the Owl Compiler.
It describes how inheritance is managed in a strongly typed object oriented
language with multiple inheritance.</FONT></FONT></I>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Owl Inheritance Techniques</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Owl has some unique problems
due to the requirement that all operations and operation invocations type
check. In a language like Smalltalk, operation invocations are not checked
at all. In fact, the actual lookup of an operation occurs at run time where
the class of an object (the ''receiver'' object) determines how the ''selector''
(the operation identification) is to be interpreted (i.e., what the ''message''
is). This is Smalltalk-ese for saying that the type of an object determines
which operation will be invoked. For example, you may have two types, integer
and graphic-object, both with the operation PLUS on them. The type of the
object being added to determines which PLUS to use.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Owl is different. Every
object in Owl has a type and when an object is used as an argument to an
operation, this type must match the declared types of the formal parameters.
The first argument to an operation corresponds to Smalltalk's idea of a
receiver. Since the type of the receiver largely determines what specific
version of the operation to use, much of the search that Smalltalk encounters
is eliminated. However, inheritance becomes more complicated. In Smalltalk,
inheritance is straightforward. You look at the current class and see if
the operation exists there. If not, you look at the next supertype. This
goes on until you find the appropriate operation.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Because of the type information,
and because of other language constructs (e.g., fixed names of type TYPE),
Owl cannot keep just one instance of an operation around. There is no tracing
upwards for finding an operation. Instead, operations are copied into each
type module so that each type has its own copy of an inherited operation.
Therefore, if some type has ten operations, then all of its subtypes will
also have copies of these ten operations, as will the subtypes of those
subtypes.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>This last point needs to
be explained a little more. In Smalltalk, an operation which is inherited
down the hierarchy only exists where it was originally entered. In Owl,
it exists wherever it is inherited. This allows not only the ''sharing''
of code, but also the ability to make small changes to the specification
of the operation without having to re-implement the operation. For example,
Owl supports the ability to hide certain operations (we call them ''private''
operations). It is possible to inherit a visible operation and convert
it to a private one. This effectively stops the inheritance of that operation
down the hierarchy.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Owl also supports multiple
inheritance. This is where a type may have more than one supertype. This
is not the case with Smalltalk since it would make its search path to find
an operation too expensive. By copying the operations down the hierarchy
tree from all the supertypes to all of the subtypes, you are assured of
having all of the operations for a specific type at one location, inside
the type module, making the search trivial.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are other reasons
for implementing inheritance by ''copying down.'' The actual types of arguments
may change as the operation is passed down. For example, suppose a formal
parameter of an operation had the type FO0, where FO0 was actually a defined
constant of type TYPE which was initialized to Integer. Further down in
the hierarchy, FOO may be redefined to be of type String. The inherited
version of the operation therefore changes (its third argument has a different
type). By having copied down versions of the operation, the type change
is easy to manage by just changing the type in the copies of the operation
affected.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Of course, this approach
is not without its penalties. As you may well imagine, in a large Owl program
with many levels in the hierarchy (the Owl environment, Trellis, for example)
you pay a price for having all of those copies of operations. Trellis occupies
over 10 Megabytes as a compiled image, and contains over 10,000 operations,
most of them inherited copies. Of these 10,000 operations, less than 3000
are ever used. This means that nearly three quarters of the operations
in the workspace are dead weight. This is one of the most pressing problems
facing Owl: How to make the workspace sizes shrink. Some of the issues
surrounding this and solutions being worked on will be in the next note.</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Owl Notes -- 4 Michael Kilian</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is the fourth and
final note in a set of notes on object oriented programming and the Owl
Compiler. It describes some of the problems with the current scheme and
approaches to these problems. Note number three should be read before reading
this one.</FONT></FONT></I>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Owl Compiler Hurdles</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>The main problem with the
trellis system is its size. Note that all of the code generated and all
of the data structures created by the compiler are stored in a single heap.
A workspace is nothing more than the image of that heap, i.e., virtual
memory. Because so much information is stored in the heap, the virtual
address space can become very large. For example, the Trellis environment,
written in Owl consumes on the order of 15 Megabytes of space.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are several reasons
for this large size. The first is the way inheritance is done. As was pointed
out in note 3, every type module has a copy of all of the operations which
may be inherited into that type module whether they are used or not. By
the time you get several levels deep in the inheritance or inherit from
several parents, there is a plethora of operation data structures in the
type module.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Second, there is a lot
of information kept around that most compilers would either throw away
or put into files. A good example of this is cross-reference information.
Attached to every operation data structure is a list of all of the operations
in the system which use this operation&middot; Every type module contains
lists describing all of its supertypes as well as the immediate subtypes.
While this may seem wasteful, it does allow the Trellis environment to
quickly tell you information which is useful in programming in Owl.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is obvious that the
majority of the heap is not taken up by code but by compiler data structures.
How do we modify the system to get rid of all of these data structures?
Here are two tactics:</FONT></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI VALUE="1">
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Put these data structures
off-line. This means that we get them out of the heap (virtual address
space) and place them into a file of some sort. Note that this discussion
does not worry about fitting Owl onto a small disk. We simply don't want
to use up all of VMS' virtual address space with structures which are only
occasionally used.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Eliminate the data structures&middot;
While this at first seems to contradict the argument that the information
stored is very valuable, some other observations need to be made. In the
Trellis environment, only a third of the operations in the heap are actually
referenced&middot; This is because we inherit many operations, few of which
are actually used (inheritance is not by demand)&middot; If these unused
operations (i.e., the data structures corresponding to the unused operations)
could be eliminated from the heap, then the resulting heap would be on
the order of 50% smaller.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>Obviously a combination of
these two techniques is necessary.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>The approach being taken
now is to begin making the access to the data structures more limited.
In fact, all accesses to the data structures will be done by manipulating
a 'descriptor' before actually touching the data structures. What is a
descriptor? A descriptor is nothing more than an indirect pointer to a
type module's or operation's data structure. It may have more information
included with it than that, but by and large it serves as a place holder
for a (larger) data structure.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>What does this gain us?
It makes the off-lining problem a little simpler. We can now off-line the
larger object being pointed to by the place holder. A flag in the place
holder is set so that access to these objects requires first getting them
from the offline source. This scheme only makes sense if the place holders
are substantially smaller than the main data structures they prefix. It
also requires that the ration of descriptors to data objects be relatively
small (1 is ideal, less than 1 would imply that you had garbage in your
offline data).</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>The second approach being
considered for a later revision of the compiler is to perform inheritance
a little differently. Instead of automatically copying all of the inherited
operations down, they should be inherited only upon demand. This means
that we go through the operations which are entered "by hand" and whenever
they require that an operation be copied down, it is.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>This does not mean that
we can stop at that. The definition of the language requires that any operation
which POTENTIALLY could be copied down must be type checked. Since symbols
can change in new contexts, this requires new nodes. What is proposed is
that after doing the on-demand part, a second pass is made for all of the
operations which were not copied down on demand but which could be copied
down in the future. The operations would be copied down, checked and then
thrown away. This means that the heap does not grow any larger than the
size of the largest definition copied down.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>If operations each have
a descriptor, it is possible that the descriptors would be kept around
and a flag would be set saying that the operation was OK, but unused and
therefore, thrown away.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style"><FONT SIZE=-1>While this last technique
has some problems, it also has potential of greatly reducing the size of
the workspace.</FONT></FONT>
