## Welcome

This is my new blog, put together using 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and 
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). It only took a few hours
to get going. My first stop was 
[Publishing a Blog with GitHub Pages and Jekyll](http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/) from Envy Labs. [Jekyll Sites Mad Simple](http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/jekyll-sites-made-simple) from Sitepoint was also quite handy.

I found info on setting up the feedburner feed in [this article](http://recursive-design.com/blog/2010/09/14/integrating-jekyll-with-feedburner/) 
from recursive-design.com.

## Testing Code Hilighting

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'check, one two three'
end
{% endhighlight %}
